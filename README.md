# circuit-analysis

This tool is used to simulate simple electrical circuits and analyze voltages and currents of a circuit with voltage sources and resistors.

# Usage

Below are the steps to run the ``circuit-analysis`` tool:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the ``src/`` directory.
3. Run the command ``mingw32-make`` to compile the code into an executable called ``circuit-analysis.exe``.
4. Run the executable with the command ``./circuit-analysis``.

# Dependencies

To use the make tool, you must first ensure that MinGW's mingw32-make package is installed on your device and MinGW's ``bin`` directory is in your system's PATH.
